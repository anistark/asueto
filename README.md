asueto
======

Asueto is a local holiday Firefox Os app made using leaflet.js and travellers love. Being a location specific app, issues might arise about the locations. Be patient. It's only in development stage now. :D

Currently, it is for bangalore only. Will be extending service to other cities soon. :) Contributions welcome.
